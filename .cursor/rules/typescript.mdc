## Typescript
- Enable strict mode
- Use strict null checks
- Prefer type inference where obvious
- No any unless absolutely necessary
- Use discriminated unions for complex types
- Use `const` instead of `let` when the value is not reassigned
- Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations
- User Types when possible, this is typescript, use types
