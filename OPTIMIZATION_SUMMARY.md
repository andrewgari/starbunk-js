## üì¶ PR Snapshot Container System

### New Features Added

1. **Dual Container Strategy**: Every PR build now creates both specific versioned containers and snapshot containers
   - **Specific**: `ghcr.io/andrewgari/starbunk-bunkbot:pr-235-abc1234` (immutable)
   - **Snapshot**: `ghcr.io/andrewgari/starbunk-bunkbot:pr-235-snapshot` (always latest)

2. **In-Place Snapshot Updates**: Snapshot tags are updated in-place to always point to the latest PR build
   - No duplicate snapshot containers
   - Always references the most current version
   - Efficient storage usage

3. **Enhanced PR Comments**: Detailed container information with pull commands for both types
   - Quick start commands for testing
   - Clear distinction between snapshot and specific versions
   - Container system information and cleanup policy

4. **Comprehensive Cleanup System**:
   - **Immediate**: PR containers deleted when PR is closed
   - **Weekly**: Automated cleanup of old containers (30+ days)
   - **Untagged**: Removes orphaned images to prevent registry bloat
   - **Protected**: Open PRs are never affected by cleanup

5. **Retention Policy Management**:
   - Configurable retention periods
   - Dry run support for safe testing
   - Detailed cleanup reporting
   - Manual cleanup triggers available

### Benefits for Developers

- üîÑ **Always Latest**: `pr-X-snapshot` tags automatically update with each push
- üè∑Ô∏è **Reproducible**: Specific versions for consistent testing and debugging
- üöÄ **Easy Testing**: Simple pull commands for PR testing
- üóëÔ∏è **No Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup prevents registry bloat
- üì¶ **Efficient Storage**: In-place updates reduce storage usage

### Usage Examples

```bash
# For testing (recommended) - always gets latest
docker pull ghcr.io/andrewgari/starbunk-bunkbot:pr-235-snapshot

# For reproducible builds - immutable reference
docker pull ghcr.io/andrewgari/starbunk-bunkbot:pr-235-abc1234
```
