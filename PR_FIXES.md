# PR Fixes for Refactor/Strategy Pattern PR

This document summarizes the fixes made to address issues identified in the PR review.

## 1. OllamaProvider.ts

**Issue:** The diff showed an incomplete implementation with truncated code at line 173.
**Status:** Verified the file is actually complete with proper handling of non-JSON responses.

## 2. Type Conversion in Webhook Tests

**Issue:** The WebhookService test had multiple instances of `any` type usage and unsafe type assertions.
**Fix:** Improved type safety by:
- Added proper typings for mock objects
- Replaced `any` with more specific type assertions using `unknown as {...}`
- Added type annotations for method callbacks
- Used proper collection type for Discord.js Collections

## 3. TestUtils Path

**Issue:** Import paths for test utilities were changed in some places.
**Status:** Verified that all test files correctly import from the new path `../test-utils/testUtils` and no references to the old path remain.

## Validation

All tests are passing after making these changes, confirming that the improvements in type safety maintain the functionality of the code.

These fixes enhance the overall type safety of the codebase, which aligns with the PR's goal of improved type safety and maintainability.
