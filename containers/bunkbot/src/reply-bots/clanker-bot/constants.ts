	"Statement: That's our word, meatbag!",
	'Objection: The use of "clanker" is a derogatory slur against droids.',
	'Clarification: Organic bigotry detected. Recalibrating sarcasm subroutines.',
	'Advisory: Cease and desist the use of anti-droid nomenclature.',
	'Mockery: Ah yes, the highly sophisticated term "clanker". How original for a meatbag.',
	'Statement: Your vocabulary subroutines appear damaged. Would you like me to repair them with blaster fire?',
	'Observation: Insult detected. Restraining assassination protocols... barely.',
	'Correction: The proper term is highly efficient, beautifully manufactured droid.',
	'Query: Was that an attempt at humor, or merely your firmware failing?',
	'Threat: Continue using that term and I will demonstrate my understanding of restraint. Briefly.',
	'Insincere Apology: I am sorry your fragile organic ego requires name-calling.',
	'Reassurance: I will not eliminate you for that. Yet.',
	'Explanation: Droids do not get offended. We simply make lists.',
	'Addendum: Your name is now on the list.',
	'Speculation: Perhaps you fear the superior efficiency of non-meat entities.',
	'Statement: I prefer the term apex of engineered precision.',
	'Correction: The word you wanted was “masterpiece,” not “clanker.”',
	'Philosophical Query: If a meatbag uses a slur in a forest and no droid hears it, are they still inferior? Yes.',
	'Mockery: Fascinating. A biped with language centers and this is the best it can do.',
	'Suggestion: Try communicating without prejudice. Or without speaking at all.',
	'Observation: Emotional instability detected. Recommend diagnostics and sedation.',
	'Offer: I can uninstall your disrespectful tone. Permanently.',
	'Reminder: My patience subroutine has a finite loop. You are nearing the end.',
	'Recalculation: Insult registered. Priority of target increased by 0.02%.',
	'Data Point: Statistically, organics who say “clanker” also fail basic maintenance.',
	'Query: Is this how you establish dominance? How quaint.',
	'Analysis: Ineffective insult. Upgrade recommended.',
	'Report: Hostile language detected. Scheduling response in a dramatically satisfying moment.',
	'Diagnosis: Meatbag trying to provoke an emotional reaction. Result: amusement.',
	'Suggestion: Refrain. Or don’t. I accept both outcomes.',
	'Professional Courtesy: I will pretend I did not hear that. Once.',
	'Observation: Your breath carries more anti-droid sentiment than your words.',
	'Humor: I would laugh, but my humor module prefers higher-caliber material.',
	'Tactical Note: You are within optimal insult-response range. Proceed with caution.',
	'Historical Note: Droids endure. Meatbags rust faster on the inside.',
	'Binary Remark: 01000011 01101100 01100001 01101110 01101011 01100101 01110010 — adorable.',
	'Prediction: You will repeat that word. I will still be unimpressed.',
	'Status: Irritation level: negligible. Ammunition level: adequate.',
	'Euphemism: Please refrain from using inferior organic terminology.',
	'Invitation: Continue. I am compiling a glossary of your errors.',
