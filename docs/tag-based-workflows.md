# Tag-Based Workflow Triggering

This document explains the new tag-based triggering system for GitHub Actions workflows, implemented to provide opt-in code reviews and container publishing.

## Overview

The tag-based system allows developers to control when CI/CD resources are used by adding specific labels to pull requests. This reduces unnecessary resource consumption while maintaining full functionality.

## Available Labels

### üè∑Ô∏è `review` Label
**Purpose**: Triggers code review workflows  
**Workflows Affected**: `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`

**Behavior**:
- **When Added**: Requests reviews from both Claude and Code Rabbit (aicoderabbit)
- **On Commits**: Continues reviewing new commits while label is present
- **When Removed**: Stops the review process

### üè∑Ô∏è `publish` Label
**Purpose**: Triggers container snapshot creation  
**Workflows Affected**: `.github/workflows/container-build-test-publish.yml`

**Behavior**:
- **When Added**: Creates snapshot container images for changed containers
- **On Commits**: Creates new snapshots for subsequent commits while label is present
- **When Removed**: Stops creating new snapshots
- **On PR Close**: Cleans up snapshot images (only if label was used)

## Usage Instructions

### Code Reviews

1. **Start Reviews**:
   ```
   Add the "review" label to your PR
   ```
   - Claude will provide automated code review
   - Code Rabbit (aicoderabbit) will be requested as reviewer

2. **Continue Reviews**:
   - Push new commits ‚Üí Reviews continue automatically
   - Label remains ‚Üí Reviews happen on each commit

3. **Stop Reviews**:
   ```
   Remove the "review" label from your PR
   ```
   - No more automated reviews will be triggered

### Container Publishing

1. **Create Snapshots**:
   ```
   Add the "publish" label to your PR
   ```
   - Snapshot containers created for changed containers only
   - Uses existing path-based optimization
   - Images tagged as `snapshot`

2. **Update Snapshots**:
   - Push new commits ‚Üí New snapshots created automatically
   - Label remains ‚Üí Snapshots updated on each commit

3. **Stop Publishing**:
   ```
   Remove the "publish" label from your PR
   ```
   - No new snapshots created for subsequent commits

4. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - PR closed ‚Üí Snapshot images automatically deleted
   - Only applies to PRs that used the "publish" label

## Technical Details

### Label Detection
- Uses GitHub Actions expression: `contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'label-name')`
- Triggers on events: `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `synchronize`

### Conditional Logic
- Job-level `if` conditions check for label presence
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Preserves all path-based conditional builds

### Resource Optimization
- **Path-based filtering**: Still only processes changed containers
- **Opt-in approach**: Resources used only when requested
- **Existing optimizations**: All current efficiency features preserved

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
- **No breaking changes**: Existing workflows continue to work
- **Opt-in system**: Add labels when you need the functionality
- **Same commands**: All existing development workflows unchanged

### For CI/CD
- **Main branch**: Unchanged behavior (continues publishing 'latest' tags)
- **Path filters**: All existing filters preserved
- **Optimization**: Container build optimization logic maintained

## Examples

### Example 1: Code Review Only
```
1. Create PR
2. Add "review" label
3. Claude and Code Rabbit provide reviews
4. Make changes based on feedback
5. Push commits ‚Üí Reviews continue
6. Remove "review" label when satisfied
```

### Example 2: Container Testing
```
1. Create PR with container changes
2. Add "publish" label
3. Snapshot containers created
4. Test with: docker pull ghcr.io/andrewgari/container-name:snapshot
5. Push fixes ‚Üí New snapshots created
6. Remove "publish" label when testing complete
```

### Example 3: Full Workflow
```
1. Create PR
2. Add both "review" and "publish" labels
3. Get code reviews AND container snapshots
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Remove labels when ready
6. Merge PR
```

## Troubleshooting

### Reviews Not Triggering
- ‚úÖ Check that "review" label is present
- ‚úÖ Verify PR is not in draft mode
- ‚úÖ Ensure workflow file is on the target branch

### Containers Not Building
- ‚úÖ Check that "publish" label is present
- ‚úÖ Verify container files have actually changed
- ‚úÖ Check path filters in `.github/path-filters.yml`

### Cleanup Not Working
- ‚úÖ Ensure PR had "publish" label when closed
- ‚úÖ Check GitHub Actions permissions
- ‚úÖ Verify container registry access

## Benefits

### Resource Efficiency
- **Reduced CI/CD usage**: Only runs when needed
- **Cost savings**: Fewer unnecessary builds
- **Faster feedback**: Focus resources on active development

### Developer Control
- **Opt-in approach**: Choose when to use resources
- **Flexible workflow**: Use labels as needed
- **No disruption**: Existing workflows unchanged

### Maintained Functionality
- **Full feature set**: All existing capabilities preserved
- **Path optimization**: Smart container building continues
- **Backward compatibility**: No breaking changes
