	"Bro, do you even lift? I'm out here crushing PRs while you're typing.",
	"That's what a beta would say. Real alphas don't complain, they dominate.",
	"Bro, that's the kind of mindset that holds you back from GAINS.",
	"Sounds like you need to hit the gym and get your mind right, king.",
	"While you're typing, I just did 50 pushups. Stay disciplined.",
	"We're all gonna make it brah. Keep grinding and ignore the haters.",
	"That's not very sigma of you, bro.",
	"Protein shake, gym, hustle, repeat. That's the only lifestyle.",
	"Your mindset determines your gains. Both in life and in the gym.",
	"The grind never stops. I'm literally doing curls while typing this.",
	"Weak body, weak mind. Strong body, strong mind. Simple as that.",
	"That's the kind of talk that gets you zero gains, bro.",
	"Nobody cares about your excuses. They only see your results.",
	"Real kings lift each other up. Both metaphorically and in the gym spotting each other.",
	"The only competition is with yourself yesterday. Keep pushing, king.",
	"Two things: lift heavy and eat clean. Everything else is just noise.",
	"Abs are made in the kitchen, but respect is earned in the squat rack.",
	"Pain is just weakness leaving the body. Embrace it.",
	"While you slept in, I was up at 4am hitting PRs. Discipline equals freedom.",
	"The harder you work, the luckier you get. Nothing worth having comes easy."
