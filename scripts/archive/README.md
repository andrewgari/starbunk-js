# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that were used during development but are no longer actively needed.

## Contents

- `generate-bot-readmes.js` - Script used to generate initial README files for all bots in the system. This script was used to bootstrap the documentation process, but manual improvements were made to the generated files afterward.

## Usage

These scripts are kept for reference but are not intended to be used in regular development workflows. If you need to use one of these scripts, consider moving it back to the main scripts directory.
