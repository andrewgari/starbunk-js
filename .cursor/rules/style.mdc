## Code Style
- Use interfaces for contracts
- Keep classes small (< 200 lines)
- Methods should do one thing only
- Max 3 parameters per method
- Favor pure functions
- One class per file
- Utils can have multiple functions if same concept
- Keep functions under 20 lines when possible
- Optimize for readability
